            drowning the earth in a blanket of bleach.

        <p>
            for years and years, <br>

            whenever i look off that bridge, <br>
            i feel the urge to jump.
        </p>
        <p>
            to feel the breeze, <br>
            and meet the wind. 
        </p>
        <p>
            to become one with the current, <br>
            and embrace the air. 
        </p>
        <p>
            to flutter from life, <br>
            down <br>
            to <br>
            earth.

            when you look up and can't see the stars, <br>
            its because they're in your eyes;
        </p>
        <p>
            when i look down and can't see your feet, <br>
            its because they're on my mind.
